Linear algebra...


\subsection{Different norms}
\begin{itemize}
\item our left-hand side $f(x) - \tl{f}(\tl{x})$ is independent of the norm, i.e. all norms compute the absolute value,
hence we are free to choose the norm on the RHS
\item on our straight-line examples we notice that p2 norm seems to perform well in the majority of cases, however not all

\item as compared to the AA computed error, in nearly most cases, our new method performs better, sometimes by
an order of magnitude
\end{itemize}
