\section{Related Work}

\cite{Chaudhuri2011} develop a technique to show programs robust, however, the technique relies
on the computed function to be continuous. This seems like a too strong
requirement, since a function may be non-continous, but still robust within a
certain constant.Furthermore, they consider robustness only wrt to one input and one output variable.


\cite{Majumdar2009} show a program robust by considering all possible
execution paths. The paths are obtained by a symbolic execution engine and the
robustness property is proven by showing that each pair of paths will not
differ by too much.


\cite{Westbrook2013} propose semantics for approximate program
transformations. They observe that the error in general is not simply a real
number such as with  metric spaces, but it is a function (of input error and
input values at the least).
